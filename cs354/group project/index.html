    <p>
        Rust is a systems programming language which usually refers to a language</br>
        used for developing system software as opposed to application software. </br>
        It has also been referred to as a general purpose and multi paradigm language.
    </p>
    <p>
        The language was originally just a pet project by Mozilla employee Grayden Hoare. </br>
        In 2009 Mozilla began sponsoring the language. They announced it's development </br>
        in 2010 and it's first stable release was in 2015.
    </p>
    <p>
        Rust's goal is to create highly concurrent, highly safe systems. </br>
        It does not permit segfaults, null pointers, or dangling pointers. </br>
        It does not use automated garbage collection. It is not object oriented,</br>
        but like C, can be implemented in an OO manner.
    </p>

    <p>
        It's emphasis in high concurrency means that as the program can be decomposed
        into different units,</br> those concurrent units can be executed out of order and
        still arrive at the same result. This means that</br> these concurrent units can be
        executed parallely which significantly increases the speed of execution.
