OVERVIEW:

 This project is centered around the RandomWalk class.
 It generates a random path through a square grid of 
 defined size.

INCLUDED FILES:

 * RandomWalk.java - source file
 * RandomWalkTest.java - source file
 * RandomWalkGUI.java - source file
 * GridMap.java - source file
 * README - this file


COMPILING AND RUNNING:

 Give the command for compiling the program, the command
 for running the program, and any usage instructions the
 user needs.

PROGRAM DESIGN AND IMPORTANT CONCEPTS:

 Explain the main concepts and organization of your program so that
 the reader can understand how your program works. This is not a repeat
 of javadoc comments or an exhaustive listing of all methods, but an
 explanation of the critical algorithms and object interactions that make
 up the program.

TESTING:

 How did you test your program to be sure it works and meets all of the
 requirements? Can your program handle bad input? Is your program
 idiot-proof? How do you know? What are the known issues / bugs
 remaining in your program?


DISCUSSION:

 Discuss the issues you encountered during programming (development)
 and testing. What problems did you have? What did you have to research
 and learn on your own? What kinds of errors did you get? How did you
 fix them?
