6.1
    This problem has n(6(n-2)) valid solutions.
    With 4 colors there are 48 solutions.
    With 2 colors there are 0 solutions.

6.3
a   Given the grid of possible word locations, start with the first available word space
    and insert a random word of the correct length. A depth first search would be the
    most appropriate, since the branching factor is the size of the dictionary. The
    heuristic is the number of remaining word intersections without both words filled.

b   The problem is formulated as a constraint grid with each letter as a variable. The
    domain of each variable is the alphabet. The constraints are that each word space
    contain a valid word from the dictionary.

    The CSP solution will be a better solution. Using the alphabet as the domain makes
    arc consistency an option, as using the dictionary as the domain is much too large
    to reasonably track.

    Coloring Search Order:
    A1 = R
    H  = G
    A4 = R
    F1 = R
    A2 = B
    F2 = R
    A3 has no valid options
    Backtrack to A2
    A2 has no other options
    Backtrack to A4
    A4 = B
    A3 = R
    T  = B

    Final State  (A1,R),(A2,B),(A3,R),(A4,B),(H,G),(T,B),(F1,R),(F2,R)
