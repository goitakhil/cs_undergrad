-> Valid test case for NULL log.
-> Correct buff.curr integer overflow protection within ring.c
-> Correct placement of sig_handler initialization.
-> Correct placement of first alarm invocation.
-> Correct placement of repeated alarm invocation.
-> -1 point, Bug exists - no check for fopen() success before writing to log_file.
-> the stdio.h function fopen(fileName, mode) will return NULL if failing to open file, not checking return pointer for NULL before using it poses a possible fail.
