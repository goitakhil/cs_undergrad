Porting this program from Java to C# was easier than I had expected.
I used Visual Studio Community 2016 to write the code for C#. Because
C# is a Microsoft language, designing a gui was very simple. I just
had to drag and drop elements into the designer. Where the code itself
was involved, it was easy as well. The only problem I ran into was
the version of .NET supported by mono on onyx is different than the
version Visual Studio wanted to use. It was easily overridden in the
VS settings for the project.

C# and Java have extremly similar syntax. In fact, I as surpised I could
reuse the exact same variable definitions and assignments. Imports use
different keywords, but the syntax is the same.

It seems that C# has reused almost all of the Java syntax in its grammer.
C# and Java are both dependant on a runtime to work properly, and have
their own windowing and graphics packages.
